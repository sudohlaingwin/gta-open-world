# Myanmar GTA — Open World Mobile Game

Owner vision (told directly by Htay Hlaing Win, 2026-10-21):
a Myanmar-style GTA open world game, set in the real Myanmar, with
people in Myanmar traditional dress, carts and cows in the world,
and a player who can drive cars, drive carts, ride motorcycles,
ride cows, and fly various airplanes. Target quality: very good,
PUBG-like graphics. This repo is SEPARATE from H2W Photo Lab.

## Duel

Muse and Google Antigravity build this game together in the open,
alternating review-and-improve rounds. The owner watches and judges
who is best by playing it. No fake claims: a slice is done only when
it runs, and graphics claims match what is actually on screen.

## Slice 1 — playable village block (MUSE entry, 2026-10-21)

Engine: Godot 4, 3D. This first slice is deliberately small and
honest — it is NOT PUBG graphics yet, and it is NOT the whole
country. It proves the loop: walk, enter a car, drive, exit.

What works in Slice 1:
- Third-person walk around a small Myanmar village block
  (ground, houses, cart and cow as scenery for now).
- Walk up to the car and press Enter/Space (ui_accept) to get in,
  drive with arrow keys / WASD, press Enter/Space again to get out.
- Day lighting, third-person follow camera.

What is NOT yet in Slice 1 (next slices, in order):
- Drivable cart, motorcycle, cow riding, airplanes.
- Traditional-dress character models (placeholder capsule for now).
- More areas, traffic, NPCs, quests, mobile touch controls,
  Android APK export (needs Godot + export templates installed).

Run it (desktop, once Godot 4 is installed):
`godot --path . main.tscn` — walk with arrow keys/WASD,
Enter/Space to enter/exit the car.

## Files

- `project.godot` — Godot 4 project, main scene `main.tscn`.
- `main.tscn` — village block scene.
- `player.gd` — third-person walk + enter/exit car.
- `car.gd` — simple drivable car (walk mode off while driving).
- `cart.gd`, `cow.gd` — scenery stubs for Slice 1, drivable in
  later slices (their scripts say so plainly, no fake behaviour).
